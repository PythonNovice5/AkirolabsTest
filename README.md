## Logging

This project uses the SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) framework for logging. SLF4J serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks, allowing you to use different logging implementations without modifying your code.

  **Logging Levels**
  In this project, we use various logging levels to categorize log messages based on their severity and importance. The following are the available log levels:

  - **TRACE**: Fine-grained details.
- **DEBUG**: Debugging info.
- **INFO**: General updates.
- **WARN**: Potential issues.
- **ERROR**: Severe errors.
- **FATAL**: Critical, app terminates.

### Current Configuration

Level: `INFO` (in `logback.xml`) under test/resources.

To change, edit `logback.xml`.
